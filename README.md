# MIPS
This project implements a single-cycle MIPS processor using Verilog HDL. It models the core components of a simplified MIPS architecture including the datapath, control unit, instruction memory, data memory, ALU, and supporting logic. The processor is capable of executing a subset of MIPS instructions such as add, sub, lw, sw, and beq.
